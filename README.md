# Task-1
I am compiling a C program that sums the numbers from 1 to 7. Initially, I used a basic configuration to generate an object file (sum1ton.o). Then, I experimented with a faster setup but stopped it midway. To run the program, I need to create an executable file (e.g., sum1ton) and execute it on a RISC-V system or emulator. The corresponding RISC-V assembly code manages the program's startup, initializes memory sections, executes global constructors, runs the main function, and performs cleanup using atexit and global destructors.
